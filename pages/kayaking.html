		<h1>Kayaking</h1>

		<p>The Saint Michael's Wilderness Program has a variety of sea kayak touring, whitewater river running and instructional opportunities for beginner through advanced paddlers. Our programs will allow you to develop strong fundamental paddling, sea "person" ship and river running skills. We achieve this by maintaining a client to instructor ratio of no greater than 4:1 on sea kayak skills focused clinics, 3:1 on whitewater skills clinics and a ratio of no greater than 5:1 on touring/expedition programs.</p>

		<p>Our staff and student instructors are trained to the highest of industry standards; all paddle sports instructors are certified SOLO Wilderness First Responders or EMTs,  have completed personal skills/leadership assessments through either the American Canoe Association (ACA) or the British Canoe Union (BCU) and have participated in a six day coastal kayak guide training on the coast of Maine.  In addition, lead Coastal Kayak Instructors are certified ACA Level 3 Coastal Kayak Instructors and whitewater kayak instructors are certified ACA Level 4 Whitewater Kayak Instructors.</p>
		Many of our programs require no prior experience and the WP provides all of the technical equipment, to include kayaks, paddles, PFD's, thermal protection, VHF radios, spray decks and dry bags. In addition, expedition programs are outfitted with state-of-the-sport camping equipment. For a list of personal equipment refer to our packing list section.</p>
