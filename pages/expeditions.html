		<h1>Expeditions</h1>

		<p>New England is an amazing training ground where Saint Michael's students can develop skills that can be applied all over the world. The Wilderness Program puts an emphasis on exploring the United States and abroad through a variety of expeditionary programs, from backcountry skiing in the Gasp√©sie of Quebec, to sea paddling the forbidding west coast of Scotland, to climbing sandstone towers in Utah or mountaineering in the Ecuadorian Andes.  The Wilderness Program offers an array of expeditionary programs ranging from five to 30 days, which generally occur during academic breaks and require significant pre-trip training and experience.</p>
