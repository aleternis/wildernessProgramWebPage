		<p>Saint Michael's Wilderness Program prides itself on providing the safest possible backcountry experiences. We are dedicated to providing training and continuing education for those planning and implementing their own adventures.

All of our programs focus on planning and preparedness and provide students with plenty of "real time," "hands on" scenarios.</p>
