		<h1>Hiking + Backpacking</h1>

		<p>Set in the heart of the Green Mountains and a short ride from the Adirondacks of New York and White Mountains of New Hampshire, Saint Michael's offers some the best hiking opportunities in New England.</p>

		<p> Whether it's a casual foliage hike, a sunset summit or an intense multi-day experience, our emphasis is on fun, safety and developing a sense of environmental stewardship through Leave No Trace skills and ethics. Our multi-day programs are designed to teach participants how to stay warm, dry and well-fed so that they can enjoy their time the great outdoors. Our instructors focus on a host of technical and outdoor living skills and drawing from a vast quantity of backcountry experience, and they all have  extensive field and classroom training to include SOLO Wilderness First Aid, Wilderness First Responder or EMT.
